# **DeleteStudentAcademicRecordById**
> void DeleteStudentAcademicRecordById (string id, string? ifMatch = null)

Deletes an existing resource using the resource identifier.

The DELETE operation is used to delete an existing resource by identifier. If the resource doesn't exist, an error will result (the resource will not be found).

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Apis.All;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Models.All;

namespace Example
{
    public class DeleteStudentAcademicRecordByIdExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://api.ed-fi.org:443/v5.4/api/data/v3";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentAcademicRecordsApi(config);
            var id = "id_example";  // string | A resource identifier that uniquely identifies the resource.
            var ifMatch = "ifMatch_example";  // string? | The ETag header value used to prevent the DELETE from removing a resource modified by another consumer. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Deletes an existing resource using the resource identifier.
                apiInstance.DeleteStudentAcademicRecordById(id, ifMatch);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)

# **GetStudentAcademicRecordsById**
> EdFiStudentAcademicRecord GetStudentAcademicRecordsById (string id, string? ifNoneMatch = null, string? snapshotIdentifier = null)

Retrieves a specific resource using the resource's identifier (using the \"Get By Id\" pattern).

This GET operation retrieves a resource by the specified resource identifier.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Apis.All;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Models.All;

namespace Example
{
    public class GetStudentAcademicRecordsByIdExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://api.ed-fi.org:443/v5.4/api/data/v3";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentAcademicRecordsApi(config);
            var id = "id_example";  // string | A resource identifier that uniquely identifies the resource.
            var ifNoneMatch = "ifNoneMatch_example";  // string? | The previously returned ETag header value, used here to prevent the unnecessary data transfer of an unchanged resource. (optional) 
            var snapshotIdentifier = "snapshotIdentifier_example";  // string? | Indicates the Snapshot-Identifier that should be used. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Retrieves a specific resource using the resource's identifier (using the \"Get By Id\" pattern).

<a id="poststudentacademicrecord"></a>
# **PostStudentAcademicRecord**
> void PostStudentAcademicRecord (EdFiStudentAcademicRecord studentAcademicRecord)

Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.

The POST operation can be used to create or update resources. In database terms, this is often referred to as an \"upsert\" operation (insert + update). Clients should NOT include the resource \"id\" in the JSON body because it will result in an error. The web service will identify whether the resource already exists based on the natural key values provided, and update or create the resource appropriately. It is recommended to use POST for both create and update except while updating natural key of a resource in which case PUT operation must be used.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Apis.All;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Models.All;

namespace Example
{
    public class PostStudentAcademicRecordExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://api.ed-fi.org:443/v5.4/api/data/v3";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentAcademicRecordsApi(config);
            var studentAcademicRecord = new EdFiStudentAcademicRecord(); // EdFiStudentAcademicRecord | The JSON representation of the \"studentAcademicRecord\" resource to be created or updated.

            try
            {
                // Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.
                apiInstance.PostStudentAcademicRecord(studentAcademicRecord);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling StudentAcademicRecordsApi.PostStudentAcademicRecord: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the PostStudentAcademicRecordWithHttpInfo variant
This returns an ApiResponse object which contains the response data, status code and headers.

```csharp
try
{
    // Creates or updates resources based on the natural key values of the supplied resource.
    apiInstance.PostStudentAcademicRecordWithHttpInfo(studentAcademicRecord);
}
catch (ApiException e)
{
    Debug.Print("Exception when calling StudentAcademicRecordsApi.PostStudentAcademicRecordWithHttpInfo: " + e.Message);
    Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
    Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
}
```

<a id="putstudentacademicrecord"></a>
# **PutStudentAcademicRecord**
> void PutStudentAcademicRecord (string id, EdFiStudentAcademicRecord studentAcademicRecord, string? ifMatch = null)

Updates a resource based on the resource identifier.

The PUT operation is used to update a resource by identifier. If the resource identifier (\"id\") is provided in the JSON body, it will be ignored. Additionally, this API resource is not configured for cascading natural key updates. Natural key values for this resource cannot be changed using PUT operation and will not be modified in the database, and so recommendation is to use POST as that supports upsert behavior.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Apis.All;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Client;
using EdFi.OdsApi.Sdk.v54.Models.All;

namespace Example
{
    public class PutStudentAcademicRecordExample
    {
        public static void Main()

            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://api.ed-fi.org:443/v5.4/api/data/v3";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2_client_credentials
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new StudentAcademicRecordsApi(config);
            var id = "id_example";  // string | A resource identifier that uniquely identifies the resource.
            var studentAcademicRecord = new EdFiStudentAcademicRecord(); // EdFiStudentAcademicRecord | The JSON representation of the \"studentAcademicRecord\" resource to be created or updated.
            var ifMatch = "ifMatch_example";  // string? | The ETag header value used to prevent the PUT from updating a resource modified by another consumer. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Updates a resource based on the resource identifier.
                apiInstance.PutStudentAcademicRecord(id, studentAcademicRecord, ifMatch);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling StudentAcademicRecordsApi.PutStudentAcademicRecord: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
